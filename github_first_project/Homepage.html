                <h3> A little more about us! </h3>
                <p class="gen-info">
                Brittle Bones Preservations was founded a decade ago by two lifelong friends, MJ and Jax, who met while both were in art school. The two shared a fascination with classic animal form studies, cultural approaches to memorialization, and Gothic art. They quickly recognized the potential to elevate respectful bone articulation from a scientific process into a meaningful, personalized art form.
                </p>
                <p class="gen-info1">
                Our core belief is that the end of a life is not an ending of beauty.
                </p>
                <p class="gen-info">
                We are passionate about making respectful and intricate pieces of work to be cherished. some of the ways we do this is by drawing inspiration from historical anatomy museums, Memento Mori art, and global traditions that celebrate ancestors and animal spirits.
Every piece is an act of respect. We work only with ethically-sourced materials, dedicating ourselves to the meticulous, dignified cleaning and preservation of remains.
 For pet memorials, we offer a service that transforms the sadness of loss into a permanent, stunning tribute—preserving the essence of a cherished companion's form.
